# xinvert

This was my project proposal for GSoC 2018. The qualifying task was to implement inversion for 5x5 matrices, ideally using xtensor.
The details of this implementation and its design can be found in the document:
https://github.com/FrozenWinters/xinvert/blob/master/docs/xinvert_design_document.pdf

Subsequently to submitting this, I given a lot of information about the project and composed the following proposal:

This repo contains the source for the project and documentation, with built document files. It also contains a diagram mentioned in the design document:
